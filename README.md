## ðŸš€ Libraries

## What it does
It scrapes the product review data from Walmart Website using Selenium.

## How I built it

1. I used selenium and python to vist the specified link and scroll down to product review section.
2. From there we head over to the reviews page by clicking on the 'See all reviews' Button.
3. Since we need the reviews from today till December 2020. We sort reviews by Newest to Oldest.
4. Then we start scraping the data from each 'review block' and after that we head over to the next page.
5. After reaching December 2020 the code stops and saves the data into a 'output.csv' file.
